## Overview

Caeli OS is a next-generation, AI-native, protocol-centric microkernel operating system designed for secure, autonomous infrastructure at planetary scale.

Built in Rust with a pure microkernel architecture, Caeli OS combines:

- Protocol-native services (TCP, MQTT, HTTP/2, gRPC)
- Mandatory security labeling at the kernel messaging level
- AI-augmented resource optimization at the system core
- Fault isolation and self-healing through strict task separation
- Hardware abstraction through sandboxed HAL drivers

---

## Core Features

- Rust-based Microkernel
- Secure Messaging Core
- Protocol-Native Stack
- AI Runtime Integration
- Self-Healing Fabric
- Real-Time Scheduling
- Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
